# Welcome to Classically Punk
***

## Task
Build an application in Python that automatically classifies different musical genres from an audio snippet.
You should expect to handle large data sets. You should also expect to analyse media files to generate data and identify patterns.?

## Description
In this project, we have tackled the problem of classifying music into the "Classically Punk" genre. The Classically Punk genre is a fusion of classical music elements with punk rock characteristics, creating a unique and distinct sound. Our goal was to develop a classification model that can accurately identify and classify songs belonging to this genre.

## Installation
Install the required dependencies by running the command: pip install -r requirements.txt, librosa etc
Download the Classically Punk dataset from a reliable source or obtain it through appropriate means.
Preprocess the dataset and extract relevant features using suitable techniques and tools.
Train the classification model using the preprocessed dataset and a chosen algorithm.
Evaluate the model's performance and tune hyperparameters if necessary.


## Usage
To classify a song into the Classically Punk genre, you can utilize the trained model as follows:

Load the audio file of the song into the project.
Extract the necessary features from the audio file using appropriate feature extraction techniques.
Preprocess the extracted features, ensuring they are in the correct format for the classification model.
Feed the preprocessed features into the trained model for prediction.
Obtain the predicted genre label, indicating whether the song belongs to the Classically Punk genre.
