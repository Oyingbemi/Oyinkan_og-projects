# Welcome to My Linear Regression
***

## Task

For example, let's say we want to know what a cat is. We can learn by heart some pictures of cats and then classify as cat animals that are similar to the pictures.
We then need a way to "measure" similarity. This is called instance-based learning.

## Description

Another way of generalizing is by creating a model from the existing examples and make prediction based on that model.

For instance, let's say we want to analyze the relation between two attributes and plot one against the other:

## Installation

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Usage

It work with !gandalf and peeer rewiew ```
